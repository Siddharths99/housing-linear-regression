# housing-linear-regression
This project demonstrates how to predict housing prices using a linear regression model built with Python. The dataset contains various property-related features such as area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, stories, and whether facilities like a main road or guestroom are available.
This project demonstrates how to predict housing prices using a linear regression model built with Python. The dataset contains various property-related features such as area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, stories, and whether facilities like a main road or guestroom are available.

The goal is to train a machine learning model that can estimate house prices based on these features.

The process includes:

Loading and exploring the dataset (Housing.csv)

Preprocessing data: handling missing values, converting categorical columns (like mainroad and guestroom) into numerical format

Selecting relevant features for model input

Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets

Training a linear regression model using Scikit-learn

Making predictions on test data

Evaluating model performance using:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

R¬≤ Score

The project also includes a simple linear regression section using only one input (e.g., area) to visualize the regression line on a scatter plot of house prices.

This project helps in understanding how regression models work and how to apply them to real-world datasets. It also introduces data cleaning, feature selection, and performance evaluation ‚Äî essential steps in any machine learning workflow.

üì¶ Libraries Used
Pandas

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib

üìÅ Dataset
The dataset Housing.csv must be placed in the same directory for the notebook or script to work.

This project is ideal for beginners who want to understand machine learning concepts through practical implementation.
